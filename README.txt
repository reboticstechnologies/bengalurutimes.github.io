Bengaluru Times — Static Website Template
-----------------------------------------

What's included:
 - index.html (home)
 - about.html
 - real-estate.html
 - transport.html
 - directory.html
 - contact.html
 - assets/css/style.css
 - assets/js/main.js

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in a browser to preview locally.
3. To enable Google Maps embeds:
   - Replace iframe src attributes with your Google Maps Embed URL, or
   - Use the Google Maps JavaScript API (you'll need an API key), or
   - Use a third-party mapping library like Leaflet if you prefer.
4. To collect contact form submissions connect the form to:
   - Formspree, Netlify Forms, or any backend that accepts POST requests, or
   - Google Forms / Apps Script to push data to Sheets.
5. To make the directory dynamic, hook the search box to an API or Google Sheets.

Notes:
 - This is a starter template designed for demonstration and easy customization.
 - Replace placeholder text, sample listings and sample map links with your real data.

Enjoy — if you want I can:
 - generate a GitHub Pages-ready repository structure,
 - add a small example backend (Node/Express) to accept contact submissions,
 - or convert the template into a React single-file app.
